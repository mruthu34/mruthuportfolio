            This was taken from my school's website since I did not have photos of me doing this.
            My school, Bukit View Secondary, has a programme called JOULES which builds us to be sustainable leaders in the future.
            In this programme, I have had many opportunities to code, such as with Microbit for my SMART city project and coding a solar car.
