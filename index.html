            <h4>
           <p> Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Senthil Nathan Mruthulan, but you can call me Mruthulan or mru . Hailing from Bukit View Secondary School, I immerse myself in the captivating realm of Media and Publicity as part of my CCA. As the Head of Photography, I find sheer joy in capturing moments through the lens of my DSLR.</p>
            
           <p>My journey in photography began during my early secondary years when I actively participated in various photo duties. However, it was when I ascended to the role of Photo Head in the executive committee of my CCA that my responsibilities evolved. Leading a team of passionate photographers, I've supervised over 60 hours of photo duties at school events, ranging from orientations and National Day celebrations to Teachers' Day</p> 
            
            This leadership role not only honed my intuition but also bolstered my confidence. Despite my love for photography, my true passion lies in coding and web development. To showcase my skills and projects, I've crafted this portfolio using HTML and CSS. Here, you'll find a glimpse into my journey, both behind the lens and behind the code. Join me as I continue to explore the intersection of creativity and technology on this digital canvas.
        <p>I have taken part in various different compeitions and different experiences to know more you can click on th Experiences tab,</p>
        <p>My passion is photography but ever since young i wanted to be a web developer and software engineer i had always wanted to do coding.<br> But i never did it uptil 2023 where i wanted to create my own website then i took up this challenge and coded this website and other projects.<br>Even though i might not have much background in coding i always feel that we need perseverance for it as it is very challeging.This portfolio<br>will have everything in my secondary school journey such as things i did events i went to and experiences i had.</p>
