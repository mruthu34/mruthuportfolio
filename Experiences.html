    <figcaption> The Smart Local, a well-known YouTube channel based in Singapore, invited me and my  CCA teammates from 
        the Media and Publicity <br> to participate in a learning experience during our second year of secondary school. We gained knowledge in digital marketing, content creation,<br> and video  production throughout our visit. 
        We gained insightful knowledge about the media industry from this entertaining and enlightening event.
